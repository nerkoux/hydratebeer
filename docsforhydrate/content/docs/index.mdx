# 🍺 Welcome to HydrateBeer

**HydrateBeer** is a lightweight, privacy-first performance monitoring SDK that tracks hydration timing, component renders, and navigation performance in your React and Next.js applications.

## What is HydrateBeer?

HydrateBeer helps you understand your application's performance by automatically tracking:

- **⚡ Hydration Performance** - Measure how long it takes your app to become interactive
- **🎨 Component Renders** - Track render durations and identify slow components  
- **🚀 Route Transitions** - Monitor navigation timing between pages
- **📊 Web Vitals** - Collect TTI, TTFB, and other core metrics
- **🔐 Password-Protected Monitoring** - Secure dashboard with session timeouts

## Key Features

✅ **Zero Configuration** - Three commands to get started  
✅ **Own Your Data** - Uses your FREE Tinybird account  
✅ **Framework Support** - Works with React 18+, Next.js App Router & Pages Router  
✅ **Lightweight** - Less than 5KB gzipped  
✅ **Privacy First** - No PII, props, or state captured  
✅ **Real-time Analytics** - Live dashboard with 5-second refresh  
✅ **Production Ready** - Silent failures, never crashes your app

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize your project

```bash
npx hydrate-beer init
```

This will:
- Auto-generate a unique project ID
- Set up a secure password for monitoring
- Configure Tinybird integration (free account required)
- Install the SDK automatically

### 2. Deploy your analytics backend

```bash
npx hydrate-beer setup-tinybird
```

One-time setup that creates datasources and pipes in your Tinybird account.

### 3. Add the Provider

```typescript title="app/layout.tsx"
import { HydrateBeerProvider } from "hydrate-beer-sdk/react";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <HydrateBeerProvider
          config={{
            projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HYDRATE_BEER_PROJECT_ID!,
          }}
        >
          {children}
        </HydrateBeerProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 4. Monitor your app

```bash
npx hydrate-beer monitor
```

Enter your password and view real-time performance metrics in your browser!

## How It Works

```
Your App (SDK) → Tinybird Events API → Analytics Pipes → Monitor Dashboard
```

1. **SDK** collects performance metrics in your React/Next.js app
2. **Tinybird** stores and processes data in your own account
3. **CLI** provides password-protected monitoring dashboard
4. **You** own all your data with full privacy
